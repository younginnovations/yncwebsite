      In response to the increasing involvement of universities in the applied
      activities of business incubation globally, the objective of this project
      is to increase university capacity in Nepal for developing
      entrepreneurship education and business incubation programming. The
      project will cover the CIMO Priority Area of promoting employment,
      livelihoods and wellbeing in Nepal, which is a priority development
      country under the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The overall goal of
      the cooperation is to share knowledge and experience gained through the
      success of the innovative and award-winning incubator programs – Oamk LABs
      – established in 2012 at the Oulu University of Applied Sciences
      (www.oamklabs.fi).
